 1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
    When committing a project to the GitHUb repository, the gitignore file instructs git which files to ignore.
    when we are generating a Java project we need .gitignore to look like this
	
   # Compiled class file
   *.class

   # Log file 
   *.log

   # BlueJ files
   *.ctxt

  # Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
  .mtj.tmp/

  # Package Files # 
  *.jar
  *.war
  *.nar
  *.ear
  *.zip
  *.tar.gz
  *.rar
 
 2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
    Fast forward in Git means simply moving the source branch pointer to target branch pointer without creating an extra commit
    or when you merge against a branch that is ahead of the one we have checked out. Both the branches refer to the same commit.
 3. Why should you have different branches?
    In a working environment, several developers work on same code. Some developers may work on fixing issues where as some developers
    may work on implementing new features. So there needs to be a machine which manages different versions of the same code
    Each developer can branch out from the main code base and separate their work from other developers using branching. 
    It also makes it easier for Git to combine versions later on.
 4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
    In a project the number of Git repositories are not limited.
